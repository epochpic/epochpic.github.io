<a href=https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit target=_blank rel=noopener>LLNL
VisIt</a>). EPOCH
comes with source code for the plug-in needed to allow VisIt to load the
SDF output files which are generated by EPOCH. There are full manuals
for VisIt which can be downloaded from the above link so no further
details will be given here. To build the plug-in, first ensure that the
visit binary is in the $PATH environment variable. Then simply type
&ldquo;make visit&rdquo; in one of the <strong>epoch{1,2,3}d</strong> directories. For more
experienced users of VisIt, the xml file which is used to generate the
plug-in is supplied in the VisIt subdirectory, called <strong>SDF2.xml</strong>.</p><p>Whilst IDL is an excellent tool for visualising 1D and 2D datasets, it
is extremely poor when it comes to dealing with 3D data. For this
purpose, we recommend the use of the <em><code>"VisIt"</code></em>
visualisation tool.</p><p>The other great advantage that VisIt has over IDL is the ability to
render in parallel, enabling the visualisation of huge datasets which
IDL would be incapable of dealing with.</p><ul><li>Initially developed by the Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced

download from the projects web page which is found at the URL
<a href=https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit>https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit</a></p><p><img src=Visit_web.png alt="The LLNL VisIT website"></p><p>There are full instructions for compiling the project from source code
along with build scripts written to help ease the process. However, this
is not recommended as it is an extremely large tool and the compilation
takes hours to complete. It is usually far easier to download a
pre-compiled binary which matches your system architecture.</p><p>However, occasionally compilation may be a necessary step. Linux in
particular is a moving target and it is not always possible to find a
binary which matches the particular combination of libraries installed
on your system.</p><p>The easiest way to install the VisIt tool is to ask the system
administrator to do it for you. However, this may not always be the best
option. The system in question may be run by someone who is not
concerned with your particular software needs or has insufficient skills
to deal with the task. In any case, VisIt has a fairly rapid release
schedule and you may find that some functionality you need is not
present in the version installed on the machine.</p><p>Fortunately, for all these scenarios it is usually quite easy to install
a copy in your own home directory. Just find a binary on the web page
<a href=https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/executables.html>https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/executables.html</a> which
closely matches your machine and download it. This can be unpacked into
your home directory with the command
<code>tar xzf visit2_10_2.linux-x86_64-ubuntu14.tar.gz</code> . The actual name
of the file will vary depending on which version you downloaded. This
will unpack the VisIt binary into a subdirectory named <code>visit/</code>. Now all
that is necessary is to add this to your search path. e.g.
<code>export PATH=$HOME/visit/bin:$PATH</code></p><p>These instructions illustrate the steps required for installing your own
copy of VisIt when you have no other choice. VisIt is an extremely large
program, so if a version is already available then it is usually better
to use the installed version.</p><p>The CSC machines at Warwick have a recent version of VisIt installed
which is available via the system. To make use of it you must first
issue the command <code>module load visit</code>.</p><h1 id=compiling_the_reader_plugin>Compiling The Reader Plugin</h1><p>One piece of compilation which is almost always necessary is that of the
SDF reader plugin. This is shipped as source code in a subdirectory of
the repository. It is located in the <code>SDF/VisIt</code> subdirectory of the
main <code>epoch</code> directory. The reader will work for any SDF file generated
by any code which uses the SDF I/O routines. You do not need a separate
reader for each version of EPOCH.</p><p>To compile, first navigate to one of the <code>epoch*d</code> directories in your
repository. Just type &ldquo;make visit&rdquo; and the build scripts should take
care of the rest. The SDF reader plugin will be installed into the
<code>$HOME/.visit/linux-intel/plugins/databases/</code> directory on your system.
Note that the <code>linux-intel</code> component will vary depending on your
machine operating system and architecture.</p><p>Each time you install a new version of VisIt you must recompile the
reader to match the new installation. It will also occasionally be
necessary to recompile when changes occur to the SDF data format or the
reader plugin itself. The developers will notify users if this is the
case, although it does no harm to regularly recompile the reader as a
matter of course.</p><p>We will see later that it is possible to do remote data visualisation
with VisIt in which the GUI is launched and interacted with on one
machine and the data files are located on a separate machine entirely.
In this situation the reader must be installed on the remote machine and
must match the setup there. The setup on the local machine is
unimportant. In fact it is not even necessary to have the plugin
installed on the local machine. This is particularly useful when using a
Windows environment to analyse data located on a remote UNIX
workstation.</p><h1 id=loading_data_into_visit>Loading Data Into VisIt</h1><p><img src=Visit_db_list.png alt="The VisIt load databasedialog"></p><p>The most straightforward method for loading data into VisIt is to start
the application and then browse the filesystem for the dataset you are
interested in. This is done by selecting &ldquo;File ⇒ Open file&rdquo; from the
VisIt menu bar. A file selection dialogue will appear allowing you to
browse directories along with the options to filter the results
according to a given regular expression and grouping options. By
default, VisIt will attempt to group all files containing the same
suffix and some kind of numbering system into a sort of virtual
database.</p><p>The right-hand pane of this window shows a list of selected files which
will appear in the main VisIt window when you are finished.</p><p>An alternative method of specifying the data file to open is to pass a
command line option when the tool is launched. An example of this method
is <code>visit -o Data/0000.sdf</code>. When the file is specified in this manner
the list of files shown in the VisIt window will also include the full
list of files in the dataset&rsquo;s subdirectory and all the files in the
current working directory. The other SDF files will be grouped together
in a virtual database.</p><p>Yet another method for selecting the dataset to use is by opening a
previously saved session file. We will discuss this further in a later
section.</p><p><img src=Visit_select_var.png alt="The Visit select plot type and variabledropdown"></p><p>Once an SDF file has been successfully loaded the &ldquo;Add&rdquo; menu item will
become un-greyed and the cycle numbers for each file in the virtual
database will be displayed. If we navigate to one of the plot types we
are able to select the variable to plot from a drop-down list.</p><h1 id=contour_plots_in_visit>Contour Plots in VisIt</h1><p>We will now replicate each of the plots which we generated using IDL in
earlier sections. For reasons which will soon become clear we begin with
the contour plot and move on to the 1D plot in the next section.</p><p>Having opened the same dataset we were using in the IDL discussion we
now select the &ldquo;Add&rdquo; menu item. Notice that many of the plot types
listed here are greyed out and cannot be selected. This is because many
of the plots are dependent on the type or dimensionality of the variable
to be plotted. If our dataset contains no variables which match the
required properties for a plot, the plot menu will be disabled.</p><p>For the current dataset there is no &ldquo;Boundary&rdquo; plot available since this
requires multi-material data and none of our variables meet that
criteria.</p><p>The list contains a menu item for a &ldquo;Contour&rdquo; plot. We are not going to
select this item since it only generates a contour plot with lines
indicating each contour level and not a filled version. Instead we
choose &ldquo;Add ⇒ Pseudocolor ⇒ Derived ⇒ Number Density&rdquo; and then hit the
&ldquo;Draw&rdquo; button.</p><p><img src=Visit_contour.png alt=" VisIT contour plotoutput"></p><p>There are many settings which can alter the visual appearance of plots
generated by VisIt. The first point of call is usually to open up the
&ldquo;Plot Attributes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Operator Attributes&rdquo; dialogue corresponding to the
plot in question. A simpler method for accomplishing this task is to
double-click on the plot in the main VisIt menu pane which will launch
the corresponding &ldquo;Plot Attributes&rdquo; dialogue.</p><p>If it is the operator attributes you wish to change, click on the white
arrow on the left hand side of the plot in the main VisIt menu pane.
This will drop down to reveal a list containing the plot and all
operators acting on it. Double-clicking on an operator will launch the
corresponding &ldquo;Operator Attributes&rdquo; dialogue.</p><p><img src=Visit_attrib.png alt=image></p><p>Another important tool for controlling the appearance of plots can be
found in &ldquo;Controls ⇒ Annotation&rdquo; from the VisIt menu bar. This allows
all of the plot annotations to be modified such as the legend, title,
axis labels, etc.</p><p><img src=Visit_annot.png alt="The VisIT annotationsdialog"></p><h1 id=d_plotting_in_visit>1D Plotting in VisIt</h1><p>A 1D plot in VisIt is called a &ldquo;Curve&rdquo; plot. We already mentioned that
this was greyed out because we have no one dimensional variables in our
data file.</p><p>The solution to this dilemma is the lineout operator which extracts a
one dimensional array from a 2D or 3D variable. This operator is
selected by pressing the button with red and blue lines located at the
top of the plot window.</p><p><img src=Visit_lineout.png alt=image></p><p>Once the button has been pressed, we can click and drag anywhere in the
&ldquo;Pseudocolor&rdquo; plot window. When we release the mouse button a new plot
window pops up containing a &ldquo;Curve&rdquo; plot of the data just selected.</p><p><img src=Visit_curve.png alt="VisIt curve plot example"></p><p>In order to change the attributes for this plot, we must first select
Active window" number 2 in the main VisIt pane.</p><h1 id=shaded_surface_plots_in_visit>Shaded Surface Plots in VisIt</h1><p>Again, we will confusingly refuse to pick the obvious plot type for this
task. There is &ldquo;Surface&rdquo; plot listed in the menu. However, most of the
time the &ldquo;Elevator&rdquo; operator does what we want and also gives us more
flexibility.</p><p>The first step is to do a &ldquo;Pseudocolor&rdquo; plot of &ldquo;Number Density&rdquo; as we
did before. Next select the &ldquo;Operator Attributes ⇒ Transforms ⇒ Elevate&rdquo;
menu item. In the pop up dialogue click on the &ldquo;Elevation height
relative to XY limits?&rdquo; and then &ldquo;Apply&rdquo;. Click &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; when the warning
dialogue pops up.</p><p><img src=Visit_shade_surf.png alt="VisIt shaded surfaceplots"></p><p>To make this plot look similar to the one generated by IDL, we have
changed the colour table using &ldquo;Controls ⇒ Color table&rdquo;. We also changed
the axis appearance with the annotations menu discussed earlier and
changed the height of the elevation using the min and max operator
attributes.</p><h1 id=creating_user_defined_expressions>Creating User-Defined Expressions</h1><p>VisIt comes with an extremely powerful method of manipulating data
before visualising the results. The basic idea is that an array is
transformed by applying a set of mathematical functions on all its
elements and then the result is defined as a new variable. Once defined,
this variable behaves in exactly the same way as any of the variables
read from the data file.</p><p>As an example, we can combine the three components of electric field to
generate a single electric field vector.</p><p><img src=Visit_expression_vector.png alt=" VisIT expression dialog showing an example vectorexpression"></p><p>Now when we return to the &ldquo;Add&rdquo; menu we see that the &ldquo;Vector&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Streamline&rdquo; and plot types now have an entry for our newly defined
vector.</p><h1 id=creating_movies>Creating Movies</h1><p>A compelling visualisation of numerically generated data is often made
by combining a series of images into a movie. This can be an invaluable
method for illustrating the basic behaviour of a system as it changes
over time. Alternatively rotating around a 3D scene can sometimes give a
much better idea of the structure in the model being presented. There
can also be much to gain by constructing visual fly-throughs of a scene,
dynamically slicing through sets of data or combinations of all these
techniques.</p><p>VisIt provides several facilities for generating movies from your data.
The simplest of these is to select the &ldquo;File ⇒ Save movie&rdquo; menu item.
This pops up a movie wizard which will walk you through the process of
generating a simple linear movie based on the time-advancing snapshots
represented by your virtual database of files. Alternatively you can
select one of the pre-defined movie templates which manipulate the
currently selected plot and create a movie from that.</p><p>Creating a simple time advancing movie is as simple as walking through
the wizard dialogue and selecting from the self-explanatory options
presented to you.</p><p>For many uses, the wizard will give exactly the desired results. However
it is occasionally useful to have a little more control over how the
movie is created. In such cases it can be useful to specify an image
format such as &ldquo;PNG&rdquo; to save to rather than &ldquo;MPEG&rdquo;. VisIt will then
generate one image per frame and number them consecutively. At the end
of the process the images can be converted into a movie using whatever
tool best accomplishes the task.</p><p><img src=Visit_movie.png alt="VisIt create moviedialog"></p><p>Another useful tip is to select the &ldquo;Later, tell me the command to run&rdquo;
radio button. This will output a long command which can run from a UNIX
terminal screen. The advantage is that no X session is required so the
command can be run in the background. It also becomes a simple task to
interrupt the job at any point and resume it from where it left off at a
later date. In a similar manner it is easy to resume a job which crashes
half way through for any reason.</p><p>More complex movies can be created by using VisIt&rsquo;s keyframing facility
which allows you to change animation attributes such as view or plot
attributes as the animation progresses. Further information about this
somewhat complex task can be found in the on-line help.</p><p>Finally, you can use VisIt&rsquo;s python scripting interface to
programmatically describe the details of each frame as the movie
progresses. This approach offers far more flexibility in what can be
achieved but is also much more involved and time consuming than the
previous two methods. Again, further information on this subject can be
found in the on-line help system.</p><h1 id=remote_visualisation>Remote Visualisation</h1><p>It was mentioned earlier that it is possible to perform remote
visualisation using VisIt. This is a process in which the data files
being interrogated reside on a different machine to the one on which the
VisIt GUI runs and where the results are plotted.</p><p>This method of working can be extremely useful when the data is
generated on a powerful machine located in an external environment such
as a large cluster. Another common use is when EPOCH is executed on a
UNIX machine and the desktop used for visualisation is running Windows.</p><p>It is sometimes possible to run a graphical tool on the remote machine
and tunnel the X-server session through to the local machine but this
can be quite slow and unstable. When connecting to a remote VisIt
instance the only data which needs to be sent between machines is the
pre-rendered image and a few simple plotting commands. Naturally, this
can be a <em><code>much</code></em> faster approach.</p><p>Also, as mentioned before, it is possible to use a machine on which the
reader plugin is difficult or impossible to compile for and connect to a
machine on which the reader is already installed.</p><p>In order to use the remote visualisation facility, you must first set up
a &ldquo;Host profile&rdquo; for the remote machine using the &ldquo;Options ⇒ Host
profiles&rdquo; menu item. The pre-compiled binaries are shipped with a long
list of pre-defined host profiles. These are unnecessary for anyone not
affiliated and can safely be removed by deleting the directory
<code>$HOME/visit/current/.visit</code> (assuming you have unpacked the VisIt
tarball into your home directory).</p><p><img src=Visit_host_profile.png alt="VisIT remote host configurationdialog"></p><p>Create a new profile by clicking on the &ldquo;New Host&rdquo; button and filling
out some of the form fields. The important ones to change are &ldquo;Host
nickname&rdquo;, &ldquo;Remote host name&rdquo;, &ldquo;Host name aliases&rdquo; and &ldquo;Username&rdquo;. If
the visit binary is not in your default search path on the remote
machine then you must specify its location by filling in the &ldquo;Path to
VisIt installation&rdquo; field.</p><p>Now click &ldquo;Apply&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dismiss&rdquo; followed by the &ldquo;Options ⇒ Save
Settings&rdquo; menu item to ensure that the profile is saved for future
sessions.</p><p>Data on the remote machine can now be loaded by selecting and picking
the desired host profile from the drop down list of &ldquo;Hosts&rdquo;. VisIt will
wait for the remote process to launch and then continue with the file
selection procedure but now displaying files located on the remote
machine rather than the local one. From this point on everything should
work as before except you should see the name of the remote machine in
the &ldquo;Selected files&rdquo; dialogue.</p><p><img src=Visit_host_files.png alt=" VisIT load file dialog showing files on remotehost"></p><h1 id=parallel_visualisation>Parallel Visualisation</h1><p>Parallel visualisation is performed in almost exactly the same manner as
remote visualisation. Again, you must create a host profile for the
purpose except this time you need to set up a parallel launch profile in
the &ldquo;Launch Profiles&rdquo; tab pane. Click the &ldquo;New Profile&rdquo; button, give the
profile a name and then set the required options in the &ldquo;Parallel&rdquo; tab
on the bottom section of the page. Selecting the &ldquo;Launch parallel
engine&rdquo; radio button will allow you to set the various launch options
which relate to the cluster on which the job will run.</p><p>The major difference now is due to the fact that VisIt must be launched
by an external job script which fits in with the queueing system used by
the parallel machine. Usually you will need to consult with the system
administrator of the cluster to confirm which launch method and
arguments to use.</p><p>The details of job launch can be better understood by reading through
the &ldquo;User documentation&rdquo; section provided at
<a href=http://www.visitusers.org target=_blank rel=noopener>1</a> . Of particular help here is the &ldquo;Getting
VisIt to run in parallel&rdquo; section and the &ldquo;How VisIt Launching works&rdquo;
entry in the &ldquo;Developer documentation&rdquo; section.</p></div><div class=article-widget><div class=post-nav><div class=post-nav-item><div class=meta-nav>Previous</div><a href=/documentation/visualising_output/visualising_sdf_files_with_idl_or_gdl.html rel=next>IDL or GDL</a></div><div class=post-nav-item><div class=meta-nav>Next</div><a href=/documentation/visualising_output/python_beam.html rel=prev>Python BEAM</a></div></div></div></div><div class=body-footer><p>Last updated on Jun 22, 2021</p></div></article><footer class=site-footer><p class=powered-by>Powered by the
