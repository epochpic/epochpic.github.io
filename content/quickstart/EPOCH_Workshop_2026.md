# EPOCH Workshop 2026

The workshop will consist of a mixture of talks and practical sessions. In the practical session you will be encouraged to work on a 'project' of your choice and of interest to your research. Demonstrators will be on hand to help with problem setup and answer questions. The workshop has **no registration fee** but you need to register [here](https://forms.gle/HHcYd9LSFYyxN8iz6).
